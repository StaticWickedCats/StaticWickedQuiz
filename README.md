# StaticWickedQuiz

The StaticWicked Quiz from StaticWickedCats is a Quiz-based game. 
This is made in celebration of St.Patrick's Day on 17th March. Moreover to bring a sense of community and «togetherness» during a difficult time (Covid). 
Furthermore to make it so we all can test our knowledge of this day, including the traditions and culture of Ireland in a fun way, as well of the use of external video chatting platforms (Zoom, Google Meet, Skype etc.), and gamification to enhance the experience. 

This project was developed by StaticWickedCats

You can visit the deployed website [here](https://staticwickedquiz.herokuapp.com/).


## 1. UX

### 1.1. Project Goals


### 1.2. User Stories
- As a user, I want to have fun on St. Patrick's day, even while in lockdown.
- As a user, I want to learn more about Ireland to celebrate St. Patrick's day.
- As a user, I want to play with my friends and/or family while social distancing.

### 1.3. Design Choices

- **Colours**: 
The colors used were shades of green, while having some specific details in a color of blue, purple, orange and pink, to link with the St. Patrick's Day theme, our main logo and give it a feel of a game. Details:

- **Fonts**: The font ‘Magz’ and ‘Orbitron’  was used, as it was or close to the logo design font as well as giving it a «game» feel. 
    Which links with the theme of a quiz game. The fonts was imported from Google Fonts and from Cufon Fonts.

## 4. Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


The testing process can be seen [here](TESTING.md).

## 5. Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
