                            used the shamrock to visually explain Christianity’s Holy Trinity. The metaphor worked well
                            for pagan Ireland, where the number three already held special significance.</p>

                            six years before escaping and returning to his family. By the seventh century, he had
                            already come to be revered as the patron saint of Ireland.</p>

                            Christians often refrain from indulgences like eating meat or drinking alcohol. But the
                            church makes an exception for St. Patrick’s Day, which means the day has been associated
                            with drinking—especially beer and whiskey, Ireland’s two native drinks.</p>
